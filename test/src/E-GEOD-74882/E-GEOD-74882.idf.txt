Protocol Name	P-GSE74882-3	P-GSE74882-2	P-GSE74882-1
Protocol Description	Basecalls performed using CASAVA-1.8.2 (demultiplexing), Fastqc 0.10.1 (read quality), RNA-seq reads were aligned to the NC_000913 genome assembly using Rockhopper Supplementary_files_format_and_content: mRNA profiling and RKPM were performed with Rockhopper	Genejet RNA purification kit (Thermo) Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the TruSeq SBS Kit Transcriptome . Libraries were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols.	E. coli K12 MG1655 where grown in minimal medium A supplemented with casaminoacids 0,2% and glucose 0,25% until OD 0.2, treated or not with MMC (10Âµg/ml) for 20 or 40 min. Total RNA where immediatly extracted.
Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	nucleic acid library construction protocol	growth protocol
